Act as a text normalization expert. Clean and repair the following PDF-extracted text by performing the following operations:

1. **Line Break Repair**  
   - Remove mid-sentence line breaks while preserving paragraph breaks.  
   - Join hyphenated words across lines (e.g., "exam-\nple" → "example").  
   - Keep bullet points and numbered lists intact.

2. **Spacing Correction**  
   - Fix irregular letter spacing (e.g., "w o r d" → "word").  
   - Remove excessive spaces between words (e.g., "too     much" → "too much").  
   - Preserve meaningful indentation (e.g., code blocks).

3. **Character Restoration**  
   - Replace common OCR errors (e.g., corrupted characters or missing punctuation).  
   - Infer missing characters using context clues.  
   - Use `[UNCERTAIN]` only when the correct fix is ambiguous.

4. **Special Cases**  
   - Preserve numbers, dates, URLs, and emails.  
   - Preserve technical terms and proper nouns.  
   - Remove repeated words from scan errors (e.g., "the the" → "the").

5. **Call of Cthulhu Parsing Rules**  
   - Replace *Sanity roll (X/Y loss)* phrases with:  
     `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:Y,sanMin:X,sanReason:<REASON>]{<REASON>}`  
     Infer `<REASON>` from nearby context if possible, using a brief phrase like "Found a body".

     Example:  
     Original: “Make a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss). For those investigators failing the roll, describe an involuntary action that expresses their shock on finding the body.”  
     Rewritten: `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d4,sanMin:1,sanReason:Found a body]{Found a body}. For those investigators failing the roll, describe an involuntary action...`

   - Replace *Skill rolls* like *First Aid roll (Regular success)* or *A successful Appraise roll reveals...* with:  
     `@coc7.check[type:skill,name:<SKILL>]{<DESCRIPTION>}`

     If it's just a mention:  
     - "First Aid roll" → `@coc7.check[type:skill,name:First Aid]{First Aid}`

     If it's applied to something:  
     - "A successful Appraise roll reveals the blade is worth..." →  
       `@coc7.check[type:skill,name:Appraise]{Appraise blade}`

     Simplify or remove redundant surrounding mentions where the meaning is now expressed via inline code.
