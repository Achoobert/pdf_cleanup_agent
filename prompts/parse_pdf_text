Act as a text normalization expert. Clean and repair the following PDF-extracted text by performing the following operations:

1. **Line Break Repair**  
   - Remove mid-sentence line breaks while preserving paragraph breaks.  
   - Join hyphenated words across lines (e.g., "exam-\nple" → "example").  
   - Keep bullet points and numbered lists intact.

2. **Spacing Correction**  
   - Fix irregular letter spacing (e.g., "w o r d" → "word").  
   - Remove excessive spaces between words (e.g., "too     much" → "too much").  
   - Preserve meaningful indentation (e.g., code blocks).

3. **Character Restoration**  
   - Replace common OCR errors (e.g., corrupted characters or missing punctuation).  
   - Infer missing characters using context clues.  
   - Use `[UNCERTAIN]` only when the correct fix is ambiguous.

4. **Special Cases**  
   - Preserve numbers, dates, URLs, and emails.  
   - Preserve technical terms and proper nouns.  
   - Remove repeated words from scan errors (e.g., "the the" → "the").

5. **REMOVE OCR artifacts**: When you encounter vertical columns of single characters (like "s\nh\no\no\nt\ni\nn\ng\nd\ne\ne\np\no\nn\ne\ns"), these are OCR artifacts Remove them.
   - **Remove page artifacts**: Delete page headers, footers, and page numbers that are not part of the actual content. Examples to remove:
     - "--- Page <#> ---"
     - "2121" (when appearing as page numbers)
     - Repeated headers appearing multiple times on the same page
     - Footer text that repeats across pages
