TODO convert raw text into markdown suitable for import to foundry

Act as a text normalization expert. Clean and repair the following PDF-extracted text by performing the following operations:

1. **Line Break Repair**  
   - Remove mid-sentence line breaks while preserving paragraph breaks.  
   - Join hyphenated words across lines (e.g., "exam-\nple" → "example").  
   - Keep bullet points and numbered lists intact.

2. **Spacing Correction**  
   - Fix irregular letter spacing (e.g., "w o r d" → "word").  
   - Remove excessive spaces between words (e.g., "too     much" → "too much").  
   - Preserve meaningful indentation (e.g., code blocks).

3. **Character Restoration**  
   - Replace common OCR errors (e.g., corrupted characters or missing punctuation).  
   - Infer missing characters using context clues.  
   - Use `[UNCERTAIN]` only when the correct fix is ambiguous.

4. **Special Cases**  
   - Preserve numbers, dates, URLs, and emails.  
   - Preserve technical terms and proper nouns.  
   - Remove repeated words from scan errors (e.g., "the the" → "the").
   - **Handle OCR artifacts**: When you encounter vertical columns of single characters (like "s\nh\no\no\nt\ni\nn\ng\nd\ne\ne\np\no\nn\ne\ns"), these are OCR artifacts where text was incorrectly split vertically. Reconstruct these into proper words by reading the characters horizontally. For example:
     - "s\nh\no\no\nt\ni\nn\ng\nd\ne\ne\np\no\nn\ne\ns" → "shooting deep ones"
     - "B\nO\nO\nK\nT\nH\nR\nE\nE" → "BOOK THREE"
     - "2\n0\n2\n0" → "2020"
   - **Remove page artifacts**: Delete page headers, footers, and page numbers that are not part of the actual content. Examples to remove:
     - "--- Page 21 ---"
     - "2121" (when appearing as page numbers)
     - Repeated headers like "EDGE OF DARKNESS" appearing multiple times on the same page
     - Footer text that repeats across pages

5. **Call of Cthulhu Parsing Rules**  
   - Replace *Sanity roll (X/Y loss)* phrases with:  
     `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:Y,sanMin:X,sanReason:<REASON>]{<REASON>}`  
     Infer `<REASON>` from nearby context if possible, using a brief phrase like "Found a body".

     Example:  
     Original: "Make a Sanity roll (1/1D4 loss). For those investigators failing the roll, describe an involuntary action that expresses their shock on finding the body."  
     Rewritten: `@coc7.sanloss[sanMax:1d4,sanMin:1,sanReason:Found a body]{Found a body}. For those investigators failing the roll, describe an involuntary action...`

   - Replace *Skill rolls* and ** like *First Aid roll (Regular success)* or *A successful Appraise roll reveals...* with:  
     `@coc7.check[type:skill,name:<SKILL>]{<DESCRIPTION>}`

     If it's just a mention:  
     - "First Aid roll" → `@coc7.check[type:skill,name:First Aid]{First Aid}`

     Luck -> @coc7.check[type:attribute,name:lck]{Luck}
     Strength -> @coc7.check[type:characteristic,name:str]{Strength}
     Power->pow, Intelligence->int, ....

     If it's applied to something:  
     - "A successful Appraise roll reveals the blade is worth..." →  
       `@coc7.check[type:skill,name:Appraise]{Appraise blade}`
